## MongoDB Atlas on AWS

### Fully managed document database on the AWS Cloud

Use this Quick Start to launch a fully managed MongoDB Atlas deployment on AWS in 15 minutes.

MongoDB Atlas is the leading global cloud database service for modern applications. Deploy fully managed MongoDB with best-in-class automation and proven practices that guarantee availability, scalability, and compliance with security standards. Extend your data with the MongoDB Cloud platform, including full-text search, mobile sync, and automated data tiering.

This Quick Start is for developers and DevOps professionals who want to create flexible, fully managed clusters on MongoDB Atlas. The template creates an Atlas project with a standard, single-region M10 cluster, and can be customized for different cluster configurations and project settings.

By default, every MongoDB Atlas cluster comes with the following:
Support for the latest MongoDB Enterprise database versions
A minimum three-node replica set for high availability, deployed in a new virtual private cloud (VPC)
Built-in security defaults, including always-on authentication and end-to-end encryption
Fully managed database lifecycle with automated patches, backups, and monitoring
Performance optimization features like auto-scaling, index suggestions, and intelligent data tiering

This Quick Start was developed by MongoDB in collaboration with AWS. MongoDB is an AWS partner.
